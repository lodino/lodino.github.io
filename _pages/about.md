I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at University of California San Diego, advised by Prof. [Babak Salimi](https://bsalimi.github.io/). I received my B.Eng. in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, and M.S. in Computer Science from University of California San Diego. My research interest mainly includes trustworthy ML, automated data cleaning, and causal inference.
