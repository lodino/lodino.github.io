I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at University of California San Diego, advised by Prof. [Babak Salimi](https://bsalimi.github.io/). I received my B.Eng. in Information Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, and M.S. in Computer Science from University of California San Diego. I am interested in developing data-centric approaches for trustworthy Machine Learning (robustness, fairness, explainability, etc).
